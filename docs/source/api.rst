retworkx API
=============

.. py:class:: PyDAG
   A class for creating direct acyclic graphs.

   The PyDAG class is constructed using the Rust library `petgraph`_ around
   the ``StableGraph`` type. The limitations and quirks with this library and
   type dictate how this operates. The biggest thing to be aware of when using
   the PyDAG class is that an integer node and edge index is used for accessing
   elements on the DAG, not the data/weight of nodes and edges. By default the
   PyDAG realtime cycle checking is disabled for performance, however you can
   opt-in to having the PyDAG class ensure that no cycles are added by setting
   the ``check_cycle`` attribute to True. For example::

       import retworkx
       dag = retworkx.PyDAG()
       dag.check_cycle = True

   or at object creation::

       import retworkx
       dag = retworkx.PyDAG(True)

   With check_cycle set to true any calls to :meth:`PyDAG.add_edge` will
   ensure that no cycles are added, ensuring that the PyDAG class truly
   represents a directed acyclic graph.

     .. note::
          When using ``copy.deepcopy()`` or pickling node indexes are not
          guaranteed to be preserved.

    While this function returns all nodes that have a path into the provided
    node.

    :param PyDAG graph: The DAG to get the descendants from
    :param int node: The index of the dag node to get the ancestors for

    :returns nodes: A list of node indexes of ancestors of provided node.
    :rtype: list

.. py:function:: descendants(graph, node):
    Return the descendants of a node in a graph.

    This differs from :py:meth:`PyDAG.successors` method in that
    predecessors returns only nodes with a direct edge out of the provided node.
    While this function returns all nodes that have a path from the provided
    node.

    :param PyDAG graph: The DAG to get the descendants from
    :param int node: The index of the dag node to get the descendants for

    :returns nodes: A list of node indexes of descendants of provided node.

.. py:function:: floyd_warshall(graph):
    Return the shortest path lengths between every pair of nodes that has a
    path connecting them.

    The runtime is :math:`O(|N|^3 + |E|)` where :math:`|N|` is the number
    of nodes and :math:`|E|` is the number of edges.

    This is done with the Floyd Warshall algorithm:
    
    1. Process all edges by setting the distance from the parent to
       the child equal to the edge weight.
    2. Iterate through every pair of nodes (source, target) and an additional
       itermediary node (w). If the distance from source :math:`\rightarrow` w
       :math:`\rightarrow` target is less than the distance from source
       :math:`\rightarrow` target, update the source :math:`\rightarrow` target
       distance (to pass through w).

    The return format is ``{Source Node: {Target Node: Distance}}``.

    .. note::

        Paths that do not exist are simply not found in the return dictionary,
        rather than setting the distance to infinity, or -1.

    .. note::

        Edge weights are restricted to 1 in the current implementation.

    :param PyDAG graph: The DAG to get all shortest paths from

.. py:function:: layers(graph, first_layer):

    :param PyDAG graph: The DAG to get the layers from
    :param list first_layer: A list of node ids for the first layer. This
        will be the first layer in the output

    :returns layers: A list of layers, each layer is a list of node data
    :rtype: list
